Meeting records Transcript 

Summary
Philipp Simon provided feedback on the product showcase, unit economics, business model, and demand-side strategy, emphasizing the need for clearer explanations and a stronger presentation of the team's strengths. Elliot Fouchy explained their current monetization approach and the challenges they face, agreeing to provide updated documents. Philipp Simon suggested a follow-up meeting to further discuss these points.

Details
Product Showcase Philipp Simon expressed surprise that the product was not clearly demonstrated in the presentation. They suggested including a product slide early on to illustrate what Polinations does, ideally with examples of user-created content like games (00:00:00). Philipp Simon specifically recommended showcasing the Roblox game with its substantial user base and monetization (00:07:08).
Unit Economics and Business Model Philipp Simon requested a clearer explanation of the unit economics and how Polinations generates revenue, especially once fully operational. They wanted to understand if revenue comes from app creation or advertising (00:09:07), and suggested illustrating with an example including active users, ad impressions, CPM, and revenue share (00:10:00). Philipp Simon emphasized the importance of a dedicated slide explaining the business model, including potential pitfalls (00:14:01).
Demand Side Strategy Philipp Simon raised concerns about the demand side of the business, specifically how Polinations acquires advertisers and their scaling strategy (00:16:46) (00:21:42). They questioned whether Polinations directly seeks advertisers or integrates with ad platforms (00:12:55). Philipp Simon suggested focusing on the supply side (developers and users) and plugging into existing platforms like SSPs and DSPs for monetization (00:18:41) (00:20:47).
Current Monetization Approach Elliot Fouchy explained their current approach using impact.com, where they have referral links for brands integrated into conversations. They mentioned a high click-through rate but a delayed conversion to paying customers, making performance monitoring challenging (00:10:53) (00:15:48). Elliot Fouchy indicated they are actively researching platforms that can handle ad mapping more efficiently (00:15:48).
Team Presentation Philipp Simon advised the team to be more confident and "bold" in their team slide (00:21:42) (00:24:24). They suggested highlighting their strengths, particularly on the supply side, while acknowledging areas for potential growth, such as marketing and ad tech expertise. Philipp Simon clarified that the feedback about presentation skills referred more to the slides' design and flow rather than the technical explanations (00:25:20).
Next Steps and Meeting Follow-up Philipp Simon offered to have a follow-up feedback session on Wednesday at 5:30 (00:22:42). Elliot Fouchy agreed to send updated documents with numbers and research on ad integration by Monday. Philipp Simon reiterated their positive impression of the traction achieved by Polinations and encouraged them to emphasize this strength (00:23:29).

Suggested next steps
Elliot Fouchy and Philipp Simon will have a follow-up meeting on Wednesday at 5:30 PM to discuss feedback.
