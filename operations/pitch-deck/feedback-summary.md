# Pollinations.ai Pitch Deck Feedback Summary

## General Feedback

### Structure & Flow
- **Opening Impact**: Start with product showcase immediately; current intro is too lengthy
- **Presentation Flow**: Know entire pitch by heart (no fillers like "um" or "hum")
- **Conciseness**: Cut content by half; aim for shorter presentation than allotted time
- **Focus**: One clear message per slide; avoid mixing technical and business messages
- **Speaker Coordination**: Single presenter preferred; multiple speakers disrupt listener's focus

### Visual Design
- **Real-time Demo**: Show live feed of generations to create "wow" moment
- **Emotional Connection**: Make the audience feel your excitement about the product
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Reduce text, eliminate acronyms without explanation
- **Media Integration**: Use videos over static images when demonstrating product features
- **Geographic Focus**: Include EU alongside China/US mentions (especially as EU-based company)

### Business Model Clarity
- **Revenue Source**: Clearly state ad-based model, not app creation fees
- **Unit Economics**: Provide concrete examples showing user→impressions→revenue flow
- **Ad Strategy**: Identify if focusing on supply side (developers) vs. demand side (advertisers)
- **Strategic Direction**: Explain planned ad partnerships/integrations (SSPs, DSPs, etc.)
- **Free Credits Objection**: Address how giving free access remains financially viable
