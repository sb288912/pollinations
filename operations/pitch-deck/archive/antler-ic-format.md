## How the Antler team assesses ideas

---

The Antler team looks at 4 different areas to determine whether to invest or not:

1. **👥 The founding team**
    1. Complementary skill set & chemistry
    2. Individual strength of team members
    3. Full-time and 100% commitment to build this company
    
2. **🛠️ The product & business model**
    1. Size and importance of problem being solved
    2. Validation (data, user/customer feedback, and intent)
    3. Scalability
    4. Timing (why now)
    5. Commercial viability (financials, unit economics, break-even)
    6. Main risks and potential mitigants
    
3. **📊 The market**
    1. Market size and potential
    2. Competitive landscape / barriers to entry
    3. Potential moat against competitors / unfair advantage
    4. Not targeting areas we do not invest in (i.e. weapons, tobacco, illegal drugs)
    
4.  **🚀 The founder-business-fit**
    1. Why are you the right person to build this?
    2. How well do you understand the pain point?
    3. What is the unfair advantage you hold in building this business?
    4. Do you have a way to connect with, and find early customers?
    5. Is the problem space interesting enough to work on for 3+ years?

## Pro tip 💡

Use ChatGPT as your sparring partner before the IC. Ask the AI to act as an Antler investment team member and to ask critical questions about your specific business idea. 

This will prepare you for the Q&A session (as similar questions might come up) as well as help you identify and rectify potential weaknesses in your pitch
