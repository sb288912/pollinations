# üí∞ **Business Model**

<div class="bg-green-100 p-1 pl-6 pr-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 mb-6">
  <p class="text-green-800">Business Model: A <em>tiered ladder</em> where apps <strong><em>automatically graduate by covering compute via ads</em></strong>. Platform revenue (<strong><em>100% retained initially</em></strong>) transitions to a <strong><em>50/50 net ad-revenue split</em></strong> for top apps (H2 2026), creating a <em>growth flywheel</em>.</p>

## 4. Revenue Streams

1.  **Advertising Revenue (Platform Retained):**
    *   During **Phase 1 (H2 2025)** and **Phase 2 (H1 2026)**, all ad income generated through the pollinations.ai SDK (v1 & v2) flows to pollinations.ai to cover platform costs and fund growth.
2.  **Shared Advertising Revenue (Nectar tier):**
    *   Starting in **Phase 3 (H2 2026)** with the General Availability of the Nectar tier, eligible Nectar apps will automatically receive **50% of the Net Ad Revenue** they generate (Net Ad Revenue = Gross Ad Revenue - Ad Network Fees).

## 9. Growth Flywheel

**The pollinations.ai Flywheel:** By solving these dual problems, pollinations.ai creates a virtuous cycle: More developers build innovative apps on our free platform -> This attracts more end-users -> This creates more valuable, AI-native ad inventory -> This attracts brands and ad revenue -> A portion of this revenue is shared back with successful developers, incentivizing further creation and platform growth, while also funding the free tier for new entrants.

1.  **Free Experimentation (Seed tier):** Easy entry and free tools attract a wide developer base, acting as an **investment in future monetizable applications**. *(Ongoing)*
2.  **Ad-Funded Scaling (Flower tier):** Successful apps integrate ads, cover their costs, and unlock unlimited usage, SOTA models, and **enhanced visibility through the Marketplace, driving app discovery**. *(H2 2025)*
3.  **Revenue Partnership (Nectar):** Top Flowers share 50/50 in net ad revenue, **turning projects into businesses** and showcasing platform success. *(H2 2026)*
