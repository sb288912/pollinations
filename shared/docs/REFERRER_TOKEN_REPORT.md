# Comprehensive Report: Referrer and Token Handling in Pollinations.AI Services

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE (May 27, 2025)

**FIXED**: Authentication bypass vulnerability in Cloudflare cache that was causing all cached requests to bypass authentication.

### Issue Summary
- **Problem**: Cache was setting `X-Forwarded-Host: text.pollinations.ai` which was being treated as a referrer
- **Impact**: All requests through cache got automatic allowlist authentication bypass
- **Fix**: Removed `x-forwarded-host` from referrer extraction and cache headers
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Authentication now works correctly for all requests

---

## Executive Summary

The handling of referrers and tokens across text.pollinations.ai and image.pollinations.ai has been **significantly improved and standardized** through the shared auth-utils.js implementation. The previous inconsistencies have been resolved with a unified approach.

## 1. text.pollinations.ai

### 1.1 Referrer Handling - **UPDATED & SECURED**

**Purpose:** Referrers are used for multiple purposes:
- **Queue bypass/priority access** for allowlisted domains
- **Analytics tracking** 
- **Ad system targeting**
- **Special model routing** (e.g., Roblox users)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Extraction Logic** (`shared/auth-utils.js`) - **SECURITY FIX APPLIED**:
   ```javascript
   export function extractReferrer(req) {
     // ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY: x-forwarded-host removed to prevent cache bypass
     return req.headers.get('referer') || 
            req.headers.get('referrer') || 
            req.headers.get('origin') || 
            null;
   }
   ```
   - **REMOVED**: `x-forwarded-host` (security vulnerability)
   - **STANDARDIZED**: Consistent extraction across services
   - **SECURED**: Prevents cache domain from triggering authentication bypass

2. **Allowlisted Domains** (`shared/.env`):
   - Environment variable: `ALLOWLISTED_DOMAINS`
   - Domains that bypass queue delays
   - Used for legitimate referrer-based authentication

3. **Special Handling**:
   - **Roblox Detection**: Automatically routes to "llamascout" model
   - **Analytics**: All referrers sent to Google Analytics
   - **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging capabilities added

### 1.2 Token Handling - **ENHANCED & STANDARDIZED**

**Purpose:** Multi-source authentication with comprehensive token support

**Implementation Details** (`shared/auth-utils.js`):

1. **Token Sources** (Priority Order):
   ```javascript
   // Query parameters
   ['token', 'api_key', 'apikey']
   
   // Headers  
   ['authorization', 'x-pollinations-token', 'x-api-key', 'api-key', 'apikey']
   
   // Request body (POST requests)
   ['token']
   ```

2. **Token Validation**:
   - **Legacy tokens**: Fast local check (performance optimized)
   - **API tokens**: Database validation via auth.pollinations.ai
   - **Enhanced logging**: Detailed validation tracking

3. **Authentication Flow** (`shouldBypassQueue`):
   ```javascript
   // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Legacy token check (performance optimization)
   // 2Ô∏è‚É£ DB token validation  
   // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Legacy token in referrer
   // 4Ô∏è‚É£ Allowlisted domain
   // 5Ô∏è‚É£ Default ‚Üí go through queue
   ```

## 2. image.pollinations.ai

### 2.1 Referrer Handling

**Purpose:** Security and access control

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Extraction Logic** (`shared/auth-utils.js`):
   ```javascript
   export function extractReferrer(req) {
     // ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY: x-forwarded-host removed to prevent cache bypass
     return req.headers.get('referer') || 
            req.headers.get('referrer') || 
            req.headers.get('origin') || 
            null;
   }
   ```
   - **REMOVED**: `x-forwarded-host` (security vulnerability)
   - **STANDARDIZED**: Consistent extraction across services
   - **SECURED**: Prevents cache domain from triggering authentication bypass

2. **Bad Domain Detection**:
   - Environment variable: `BAD_DOMAINS`
   - Transforms prompts to "semantic opposites" with 60% probability
   - Prevents abuse from specific domains

3. **Approved Referrers** (`createAndReturnImages.js`):
   - Hardcoded list of approved domains
   - Grants access to GPT Image model without token
   - Includes: pollinations.ai, github.com, reddit.com, discord.com, etc.

### 2.2 Token Handling

**Purpose:** Queue bypass and premium model access

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Token Sources** (`config/tokens.js`):
   ```javascript
   // Priority order:
   1. Query parameter: ?token=xxx
   2. Authorization header: Bearer xxx
   3. Custom header: x-pollinations-token
   4. Fallback to referrer headers (weird!)
   ```

2. **Valid Tokens**:
   - Environment variable: `VALID_TOKENS` (comma-separated)
   - Stored as a Set for O(1) lookup
   - Grants:
     - Queue bypass for non-GPT models
     - Access to GPT Image model

3. **Token Benefits**:
   - Skip rate limiting queue
   - Priority processing
   - Access to restricted models

## 3. Major Issues Identified

### 3.1 Inconsistent Referrer Extraction
- Both services check multiple header variations
- No standardized extraction function
- Fallback to referrer headers in token extraction (image service)

### 3.2 Mixed Purposes
- Referrers serve too many purposes:
  - Analytics
  - Access control
  - Model routing
  - Ad targeting
  - Rate limiting

### 3.3 Security Concerns
- Referrer headers can be easily spoofed
- Using referrers for authentication is insecure
- Token extraction falls back to referrer headers

### 3.4 Hardcoded Values
- Approved domains hardcoded in image service
- No centralized configuration

### 3.5 Naming Inconsistencies
- "referer" vs "referrer" throughout codebase
- "WHITELISTED_DOMAINS" vs approved domains list
- Different environment variable patterns

## 4. Recommendations

### 4.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Standardize Referrer Extraction**:
   ```javascript
   // Create shared utility
   export function extractReferrer(req) {
     return req.headers.get('referer') || 
            req.headers.get('referrer') || 
            req.headers.get('origin') || 
            null;
   }
   ```

2. **Separate Concerns**:
   - Use referrers ONLY for analytics
   - Use tokens for authentication/access control
   - Create separate flags for model routing

3. **Fix Token Extraction**:
   - Remove referrer fallback in image service
   - Standardize token header usage

### 4.2 Long-term Improvements

1. **Unified Authentication System**:
   - Implement proper token-based authentication
   - Consistent token validation across services
   - Rate limiting based on authenticated users

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Move all domain lists to environment variables
   - Create shared configuration service
   - Document all environment variables

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Don't rely on referrers for security
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Add request signing for internal services

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Create shared libraries for common functionality
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Proper TypeScript interfaces

## 7. Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Standardize referrer extraction into a shared utility function
   - Move all hardcoded domain lists to environment variables
   - Remove referrer fallback in image.pollinations.ai token extraction
   - Implement proper logging for all authentication attempts

2. **Authentication Strategy:**
   - **Frontend Apps (no backend)**: Use referrer-based identification + IP-based queuing
   - **Backend Apps**: Use token-based authentication with no queuing
   - Maintain simple token validation (string comparison)
   - No JWT implementation needed for text/image APIs

3. **Short-term Improvements:**
   - Create unified token validation middleware
   - Standardize token extraction (Authorization header, x-pollinations-token, query param)
   - Implement token-based usage tracking (no queue for token requests)
   - Clear separation: referrers for analytics/identification, tokens for authentication

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Keep referrer checking for frontend apps (browser-based usage)
   - Bypass IP queue for valid token requests
   - Track usage by token instead of IP for backend apps
   - Maintain whitelist for trusted domains (queue bypass)

## 9. Final Recommendations

Based on all findings and the simplified authentication strategy:

1. **Immediate**: Standardize token/referrer extraction utilities
2. **High Priority**: 
   - Implement token-based queue bypass in both services
   - Remove referrer fallback from token extraction
   - Consolidate domain allowlists to environment variables
3. **Medium Priority**: 
   - Create shared authentication utilities
   - Implement token-based usage tracking
   - Standardize error responses
4. **Low Priority**: Clean up legacy code and improve documentation

The simplified approach maintains security while being practical:
- Frontend apps use referrer + IP queuing (current behavior)
- Backend apps use tokens for authentication and bypass queuing
- No complex JWT infrastructure needed for the APIs
- auth.pollinations.ai remains separate for user management
